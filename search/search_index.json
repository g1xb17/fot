Name Level Range Notes Mileth Crypt (1-3) 3 - 15 Enemies on floors 1 and 2 have no elemental defense. Tagor Path 8 - 20 All enemies are undead. Effective for solo Priests. Astrid (South) 11 - 25 All enemies are passive. Dubhaim Castle 20 - 50 Dunans drop Talos Fragments. Effective for solo Priests. Lynith Sea 31 - 55 All enemies are passive in entrance. House Macabre (Nikuru) 41 - 50 Nikuru are passive. Undine Field (North) 50 - 65 Cthonic Remains (11-30) 61 - 99 Kasmanium Mines 65 - 99 Oren Sewers Cube Rooms 99 Very high experience with Wizards casting Gar spells. Very dangerous. XP Drain Every additional group member drains a small amount of XP (~7%) that would be granted to the group. Additionally, the level difference between the highest level group member and lowest level group member should not be more than 20. A difference of 20 or greater will result in a severe experience penalty for group members. XP Loss In order to receive full experience for a kill, your character will need to be within 15 levels of the slain monster. Group Composition Although group compositions can be varied, it's generally important to have access to the spell \"Fas Nadur\" (or its variants) and healing. This generally means bringing a Wizard and Priest to every group. Monks, Warriors, and Rogues can be great damage dealers, with Monks and Warriors being able to take damage from enemies and rogues providing crowd control abilities. While not necessary, it can be very helpful to have someone read the elements of the enemies' defense. Otherwise, you will have to guess the defensive elements, which will likely involve rotating through your elemental necklaces or elemental attacks until you find one that does the amount of damage you're expecting. Sign Quests There are signs that exist in hunting areas throughout Temuair. These signs will offer quests to slay 10 of a particular kind of enemy and reward you with a level-appropriate amount of XP for completing the quest. You can do these quests 4 (?) times per day, per location (i.e. Mileth Crypt, East Woodlands, etc.). However, it is possible that if you level into a different level bracket, you may be able to do quests again at a particular location after previously completing them all. It's worthwhile grabbing these sign quests regularly while hunting, if it doesn't take too long to travel back and forth. Experience Needed The following is a table of how much experience you need in order to level. This table is an estimation of the leveling formula, and appears to be inaccurate by no more than 5 XP at any level.

After completing a necessary quest, you can ascend for health and mana by placing a succubus hair into the Mileth altar and speaking with either Deoch (health) or Gramail (mana). Furthermore, you can purchase stats in exchange for health or experience by speaking with Bedor in the Temple of Choosing in Mileth. Ascension Quest In order to be able to ascend, you need to complete the quest to slay the Bone Dragon at the bottom of the Kasmanium Mines, given to you by Ludar in Camp A'Chaid. After slaying the Bone Dragon, be sure to speak with Ludar again to fully complete the quest. Experience Cost When ascending for stats directly at the Temple of Choosing, the experience cost formula appears to be as follows. Credit goes to Pablito for discovering this formula. Let STAT be the current base value of the stat you're going to raise. XP COST = STAT * (BASE_HP * 17) Example For example, if my base HP is 5000 at I want to raise my strength from 100 to 101 then it will cost: XP COST = 100 * (5000 * 17) XP COST = 8,500,000 Remarks You should consider only purchasing stats with experience when your HP is at or near its minimum (4000). When done this way, you will spend less experience overall when maxing your stats . Once a particular stat is higher than 150, it may be more effecient in terms of experience to purchase stats one by one by ascending for 250 HP and turning that HP into one stat. However, this will require you to use a Succubus hair for every stat point placed using this method.","title":"Ascending"},{"location":"classes/ascending/#ascending","text":"Ascending is the process of exchanging experience for more character power: health, mana, and stats.

This is somewhat difficult because priests need a lot of stats to learn all of their pre-master spells. However, it is possible to sub with all spells and extra stats using various items, but your final stats may vary slightly depending on what items you have access to. You can choose any religion , but remember to incorporate those gained stats as part of your base stats. Choosing Ceannlaidir or Sgrios will make the stat plan more challenging, but still possible.

For example, with a full set of +10 gear, you will likely not need any fragments. If you choose to create upgraded gear for yourself, it is recommended that you start with chest armour and a Hy-Brasyl belt, as these items slots typically do not provide stats normally, and you'll immediately get a benefit when upgrading them to +5.

In this way, you will have the largest benefit to your mana pool by the time you reach a high level. You can fulfil your role as a priest knowing only healing spells and few other spells. Cradh spells are helpful, but they don't seem to have as large of an impact on the time to kill a monster as Fas does. Personally, I found learning Deo Saighead around level 41 to be very helpful, as it meant I could solo somewhat better.

Of course, there are many different strategies for allocating stats and this is not a definitive guide, but the following will be an overview of character stats and some general advice. Overview Stat Effect Strength Increases the damage of assails (melee attacks) Increases carrying capacity Important for Warriors Intelligence Increases the damage of spells Important for Wizards and Priests Wisdom Increases mana regeneration Increases mana gained per level Important for Wizards and Priests Somewhat important for Monks and Rogues Constitution Increases health regeneration Increases health gained per level Increases the damage of Monk abilities Important for Warriors and Monks Somewhat important for Rogues, Wizards, and Priests Dexterity Increases the damage of Rogue abilities Increases the damage of some Warrior abilities Important for Rogues Somewhat important for Warriors and Monks General Advice In general, it's important to invest most of your early stats into Constitution, Wisdom, or both (depending or your class). This is because the amount of health and mana you gain per level is dependent on your Constitution and Wisdom, respectively, and the earlier you invest in these stats the more levels there are to benefit from the investment. Depending on what sort of access to stat items you have, you may need to put a few points in other stats to function as your class, but you should try to put as many points in Consitution and Wisdom as early as possible (as makes sense for your class). As a rough benchmark: Rogues will benefit greatly from raising their Constitution and Wisdom to 20 before investing much in dexterity. Priests should try to raise their Wisdom to 50, putting only the minimum they need into Intelligence, before raising other stats. Warriors and Monks should aim to raise their Constitution to 40 before investing much in other stats. Wizards should try to prioritize Wisdom for Sal spells, while ensuring they are able to learn Fas spells. Additionally, whether or not you plan on subbing can change how you want to place your stats. When subbing from Priest or Wizard, you will likely need to be very careful in your stat placement, and not raise any one stat too highly, whereas these concerns don't matter as much if you're going Pure. Notably, although Intelligence is an important stat for Wizards, if you're subbing from a Wizard to another class, you won't need very much Intelligence to obtain all your spells. However, a Wizard that is going Pure would benefit very much from having a high Intelligence. Maximum Stats Before transcending your character, the maximum stats you can obtain depends on your class.

Speak with Bedor (the mysterious old man) in the Temple of Choosing in Mileth to find out more information about walking another path.

These boss fights can be repeated every two hours. Considerations With items, fragments, and upgraded gear, it is possible to get all pre-master skills and spells before subbing. However, this will be especially difficult for Wizards. If you are a Priest, remember to obtain your god's relic before subbing. Remember to get all of your class specializations !

The Goblin Blacksmith can be found by entering East Woodlands 6-1, following the path until the intersection, and then heading right (east) until you enter East Woodlands 10-1. From there, continue east until you reach the Blacksmith's house (41, 26). Speak with the Goblin Blacksmith in order to exchange a Goblin Armour Piece for your armour. Goblin Armour Pieces can be found randomly by slaying goblins through Temuair (West Woodlands, East Woodlands, etc.). The Goblin Armour Piece does not drop from the slain goblin to the ground, but rather will appear directly in your inventory after slaying the goblin. You can exchange Goblin Armour Pieces for level 41 armour as many times as you would like. Level 71 Armour The Grounds Keeper of Dubhaim Castle Grounds will craft level 71 armour of your class, after defeating a Dubhaim Cleric, in exchange for Dubhaim Cloth. The Grounds Keeper is located on the north side of the Dubhaim Castle Grounds (13, 9) and will only speak to Aislings if they can trust you're not dangerous. In order to convince the Grounds Keeper you're not dangerous, say \"Greetings\" out loud. The Keeper will give you a quest to venture into Dubhaim and defeat a Dubhaim Cleric. The altar for summoning Dubhaim Clerics can be found in Dubhaim Castle North (entrance 34, 10). Proceed to Dubhaim Castle North 4-3, turn west, and enter Dubhaim Castle North 5-1. You will need to place Dubhaim skulls (Ghast Fiend, Gargoyle, etc.) into the altar in order to summon a creature. Often, further ghasts and gargoyles will be summoned, but sometimes a Dubhaim Cleric will be summoned. Defeat the Dubhaim Cleric and obtain Dubhaim Cloth. Return to the Grounds Keeper with your Dubhaim Cloth and they will craft your level 71 armour. You can continue to exchange Dubhaim Cloth for more level 71 armour. Level 97 Armour Level 97 armour is crafted by obtaining a Kasmanium Chest from the Dracos of Kasmanium Mines. Alternatively, one of the quests offered by Ludar in Camp A'Chiad will have you slay a boss at the bottom of the mines and reward you with a Kasmanium Chest.

Fragments have a very low chance (estimated 1/250 - 1/1000) of dropping when killing an enemy. Each enemy has the potential of dropping a fragment unique to that named enemy (i.e. 'Mantis', 'Grimlock Guard'). These fragments can be used to empower items, like an enchantment, which provides the item with additional effects. Some effects are seemingly minor, such as Fragment of Viper (+25 HP), whereas other fragments can potentially define entire character playstyles, such as Fragment of Medusa (-1 Spell Lines) and Fragment of Shamansyth (allows any weapon to be used by Rogues). Usage Items are empowered by fragments by placing the item you wish to empower in the first slot of your inventory and double-clicking the fragment. A window explaining the fragment will appear and you will be able to confirm that you wish to expend the fragment to empower the item. Each fragment can only empower a single type of item (i.e. boots, gloves, etc.). When a fragment is used, it is destroyed. You can empower a single item with up to two fragments. These can be two of the same type of fragments or different types of fragments. When you empower an item with a fragment, its name will change to reflect that it is empowered.

Additionally, you can access the God's Prayer for the allies of your god by visiting their temples and speaking with their clerics. Activity Effect (God's) Prayer. Pray to the God. This will require labour. Desecrate an enemy item. Destroys an item of an enemy god in your inventory to reward faith. Lost necklace. Allows you to purchase a new prayer necklace. Altar These activities can be performed at the foot of the altar of your gold, but not with the other gods in your trinity. These activities do not require labour.

Fiosachd's prayer provides group stealth and may be useful when taken by a Rogue or White Bat Monk, as they will be able to stealth their party and themselves (using their own abilities). Glioca's prayer provides a 1 minute Dion effect, which may be useful if you do not have access to Dion. Luathas' prayer provides a temporary +5 intelligence, and may make certain stat builds easier. However, you may also join Cail or Gramail and still pray at the Luathas temple for this effect. All of the prayer effects, except for Luathas Gnosis (+5 Int), appear to be copies or variants of priest spells.

Completing the Medusa Creant quest is part of Grand Mastering and is required to transcend your class. Quest In order to create the Medusa Talisman, you will need to collect: Left Talisman Half Right Talisman Half Polished Pearl Pouch of Gems These Oren Ruins maps (external site) may be helpful when navigating the ruins. Polished Pearl In order to obtain the Polished Pearl, you will first need to travel to the Nobis Pub in Nobis Village and speak with Duncan to purchase a Dusty Pearl for 1,000,000 Gold. You can reach Nobis Village by first travelling to Oren. After arriving at Oren, you can click on the Oren Codex by the docks to travel instantly to the Oren City tower. From the tower, travel north until you reach the entrance to Oren Jungle (50, 1). Continue north through Oren Jungle until you reach the Nobis gates (29, 19). Say, \"Welcome Aisling\" out loud to enter the gates. You will arrive at the Nobis Passage. From the Nobis Passage, travel west until you reach Nobis Village (1 ,11). Duncan can be found in the corner of the Nobis Pub (Nobis Village - 29, 49). Speak with him to purchase a Dusty Pearl for 1,000,000 Gold. You transform your Dusty Pearl into a Polished Pearl by entering Lynith Sea 1. Note that the first underwater room of Lynith Sea is called \"Lynith Sea\", but you need to enter the second underwater room, called \"Lynith Sea 1\". Upon entering the room, you will receive a message saying your pearl has been transformed. Talisman Halves The Left and Right Talisman Halves can be found as drops from monsters in the Oren Ruins, which you will travel through in order to collect your Bag of Gems. You will likely complete this part of the quest while defeating enemies while you travel and I recommend starting with the the Pouch of Gems before (explicitly) farming the Talisman Halves. The Left Talisman Half drops from monsters on the second floor of Oren Ruins and the Right Talisman Half drops from enemies on the third floor of Oren Ruins. Pouch of Gems Collecting the Pouch of Gems is the most time-intensive part of the Medusa Creant quest. In summary, you will need to dig up bones in Oren Ruins and then summon a chain of mini-bosses throughout Oren Ruins. The Oren Ruins can be accessed by travelling north through Oren Village (30, 1). You should walk through the gate, rather than around, as it is considered bad luck not to do so. While you are travelling throughout the Oren Ruins, you may wish to not cas Fas Nadur on yourself, as enemies cast Light elemental spells and have Dark melee attacks. Copper Bones You will need to collect nine Copper Bones throughout the outside part of Oren Ruins. In order to dig up the bones, you will need to buy a shovel and assail with it equipped. If you cannot unequip your equipped weapon because of subpathing, it is possible to have another character dig up with bones for you. However, there is a cooldown between the time any character can dig up the same bones twice. Oren Ruins 1-5 Copper Bone 1: (10, 19) Oren Ruins 1-6 Copper Bone 2: (43, 47) Copper Bone 3: (12, 31) Oren Ruins 1-7 Copper Bone 4 and 5: (65, 32) Oren Ruins 1-8 Copper Bone 6: (12, 32) Copper Bone 7: (57, 22) Copper Bone 9: (65, 83) Copper Bone 8: (10, 82) When you are finished digging up the bones, you should have a total of nine Copper Bone pieces. Ruby Gemstone The Ruby Gemstone is obtained by using your Copper Bones to summon the Copper Draco in the Oren Ruins Altar 1 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 2-16). The Copper Draco is Dark defense and Dark attack. You may need to recast debuffs if the Draco clears them. Suain makes the fight much easier. The Copper Draco drops the Ruby Gemstone and also has a chance of dropping the same kind of bones that are dug up outside in the Oren Ruins. It may be possible to summon and additional Dracos if you get enough of such bones. Sapphire Gemstone The Sapphire Gemstone is obtained by defeating the Ancient Lava Golem in the Oren Ruins Altar 2 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 2-10). Summoning the Golem will consume your Ruby Gemstone, but reward you with a Sapphire Gemstone. The Lava Golem has Fire Defense, so be sure to use Sea element when fighting it. You may need to recast debuffs in the fight. Suain makes the fight much easier. Amber Gemstone The Amber Gemstone is obtained by defeating the Ancient Fire Hydraco in the Oren Ruins Altar 3 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 3-10). Summoning the Hydraco will consume your Sapphire Gemstone, but reward you with an Amber Gemstone. The first phase has Fire defense. The second phase has Light defense. The third phase has Dark defense. You may need to cast debuffs if the fight goes slowly. Suain makes the fight much easier. Obtaining the Pouch The Pouch of Gems is obtained by defeating the Ancient Fire Drake in the Oren Ruins Altar 4 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 3-16). Summoning the Drake will consume your Amber Gemstone, but reward you with a Pouch of Gems. The Drake has Dark defense. You may need to recast debuffs in the fight. Suain makes the fight much easier. Medusa Talisman Ensure you have all the requirements in order to create the Medusa Talisman: Left Talisman Half Right Talisman Half Polished Pearl Pouch of Gems Return to Duncan in the Nobis Pub (Nobis Village - 29, 49) and tell him that you found talisman pieces and he will forge them into an Empty Talisman. If you speak to him again, he will forge the Medusa Talisman by combining the Empty Talisman with your Polished Pearl and Pouch of Gems. Medusa Creant Fight The Medusa is summoned in the Oren Ruins Altar 5 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 3-2). Medusa has a random defensive element, so be sure to read the element to know which offensive element to use. You will need to recast debuffs in the fight, as Medusa will remove them regularly from herself. Keeping Suain cast on Medusa will make the fight much easier. She will summon a small amount of monsters (1-3) a few times in the fight when her health drops below certain thresholds.

Udom, the Tagor Citizen, of Tagor (40, 70) is getting a bit too old to fight the undead himself, and would like your help protecting Tagor. Speak with Udom and agree to help him. Then head to the Old Macabre Pass off the path in Tagor (0, 35) and slay one zombie. This is a dangerous area for low-level characters and you should bring help if you attempt this at level 8. You will need to get the last hit on the zombie in order to get credit for the quest. Return to Udom and inform him you've slain a zombie. He will reward you with 10,000 XP. He will then ask you to find his keys, which he lost on the north side of Tagor while sleeping behind the Ranger Station. Head to Nigel's House (29, 12) and exit through the back door (8, 0). Search around (59, 5) for Udom's keys and return to him with them. He will reward you with 20,000 XP. Udom will ask one more favour of you. He would like you to confirm the rumour of zombies coming up through the floor of an old house. You will need to return to the Old Macabre Pass and make your way to the edge of the map (0, 38). There you will find a Cthonic Map sticking out from beneath the rubble with evidence of the Cthonic Ruins.
